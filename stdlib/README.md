# Oak standard library, bootstrap implementation

`import(std)` loads the embedded Oak source in `stdlib/std.oak` through the
normal compiler pipeline. The library executes as generated C; its functions
are not Go runtime shims. Use `go run . program.oak` to emit C, then compile
that C with `cc -std=c99 -O2 program.c -o program`.

The bootstrap module has unqualified exports. Repeated imports are idempotent;
conflicting declarations, aliases and unknown imports are rejected. A general
package loader and qualified module names remain future work. The interactive
REPL currently uses its older pipeline and does not load this module.

## Values and generic functions

`Option[T]`, `Result[T,E]`, and `Overflow` have canonical declarations within a
compilation using `import(std)`. Checked integer conversions use these declarations.
`option_or[T](item, fallback)` returns the payload or the supplied fallback.
Its fallback is evaluated eagerly, as an ordinary function argument.

Explicit calls such as `identity[u32](x)` and `ring_push[u8](cursor, data, x)`
specialize first-order unconstrained functions. Each concrete signature and body
passes type checking, borrow checking and discipline analysis. Specializations
use direct calls and inline values, with no boxes, vtables or allocation.

The initial argument set is fixed-width integers, Bool and concrete named types.
Const parameters on functions, composite type arguments, inferred generic calls,
generic methods, and first-class generic function values are not implemented.
Constrained functions retain the existing type-checking path; unsupported generic
bodies are rejected before C emission. Programs are limited to 256 specializations.
Unused unconstrained templates are not emitted or universally body-checked.

## Ring over caller-owned storage

Create an initialized element array and a zero-initialized `[1]RingCursor`, then
borrow each with `span`. Capacity is the storage span's length and must be nonzero.
Keep that cursor paired with that storage for its active lifetime. All operations
require exclusive access; this is a sequential ring, not a concurrent SPSC queue.

```oak
import(std)

main: (): i32 {
  data: [8]u8
  state: [1]RingCursor
  storage: [*]u8 = span(&data)
  cursor: [*]RingCursor = span(&state)
  inserted: RingPush = ring_push[u8](cursor, storage, u8(42))
  item: Option[u8] = ring_pop[u8](cursor, storage)
  i32(option_or[u8](item, u8(0)))
}
```

| Operation | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `ring_push[T]` | `Inserted` appends; `Full` leaves cursor and storage unchanged |
| `ring_pop[T]` | `Some(T)` removes the oldest element; `None` leaves an empty ring unchanged |
| `ring_check` | Checks cursor span length, nonzero capacity, head range and occupancy |

Push and pop do O(1) bookkeeping plus one element copy; storage costs O(capacity).
No operation grows or allocates. Index wraparound avoids overflowing `head+count`.
The cursor has explicit value semantics: copying it does not transfer ownership,
create independent storage, or duplicate a resource capability. This initial API
is for initialized copyable values; it does not enforce unique resources,
destruction or cursor/storage pairing through typestate.

A future owning `Ring[T,N]` wrapper can bind storage and cursor once borrowing of
aggregate storage is fully supported. The current API exposes both borrows rather
than accidentally passing a whole fixed-size ring by value.

## Bytes

| Function | Result and work |
| --- | --- |
| `bytes_copy_into(dst, src)` | `Result[u32,CopyError]`; copies all bytes in O(length), or returns `DestinationTooSmall` before any write |
| `bytes_equal(left, right)` | Bool; O(length) when lengths agree; not a cryptographic constant-time comparison |
| `bytes_find(src, needle)` | `Option[u32]` containing the first matching index; O(length) |

Byte functions allocate nothing. Copy requires the normal nonconflicting
source/destination borrows; it is not an overlapping-memory move primitive.

## Verification and remaining work

`compiler/e2e_stdlib_test.go` compiles real imported Oak through the compiler and
system C compiler and executes the result. It covers typed outcomes, independent
ring instances, wraparound, capacity one, full/empty behavior, byte-copy failure,
explicit specialization and negative compilation cases. Seeded traces compare
128 operations at capacities 1, 3 and 8 against a plain sequence model; invalid
cursor fields must trap.

The standard-library workflow runs the full Go suite with the race detector. These are implementation tests, not formal refinement proofs. Native
Apple Silicon execution, PAC/tag representations, capability transfer/revocation,
pools/intrusive structures, concurrent rings, broader collections and persistence
protocols remain separate work; importing this module does not implement them.

# Lean extraction

**Status: implemented subset.** `codegen/lean`, `oak build -lean out.lean`,
`Compilation.EmitLean`. The extraction is the roadmap's step 3 for the
verification experiment (`experiments/verification-poc`): a mechanical
translation of type-checked Oak into Lean 4 definitions, so that "this Lean
model is the Oak program" is a property of a small translator rather than of
a person reading two sources side by side.

## 1. What it is for

The experiment proves things about Lean models and relates them to compiled
Oak by running both on corpora. Before extraction, the model of the Oak
decoder was written by hand (`proof/OakText.lean`), and its fidelity to the
Oak source was an assumption checked only by corpus agreement. The extractor
produces `proof/OakTextExtracted.lean` from the same three Oak files the
compiler compiles. The remaining assumption between compiled Oak and the
extracted model is now "the compiler and this translator are correct", two
programs whose behavior is fixed and testable, and the hand-written model
becomes a proof intermediate whose relation to the extraction is itself
checkable.

## 2. The translation

The output is the shallow embedding the hand-written models use, so the
proofs written against them transfer.

| Oak | Lean |
| --- | --- |
| `u8` `u16` `u32` `u64`, `i8`..`i64` | `UInt8` .. `UInt64`, `Int8` .. `Int64` — wrapping arithmetic, the same widths |
| `Bool`, `()` | `Bool`, `Unit` |
| `[N]T`, `[]T`, `[*]T` | `Array T` — a value; a view is the array it views, a span is returned |
| `Name: type = struct { ... }` | `structure Name where ...` deriving `Repr, Inhabited, BEq` |
| `f: (p: T, s: [*]U): R` | `def f (p : T) (s : Array U) (fuel : Nat) : Option (R × Array U)` |
| local `x: T = e`, `x = e` | `let x : T := e`, `let x := e` (rebinding) |
| `arr[i] = v` | `let arr := arr.setIfInBounds i.toNat v` |
| `r.field = v` | `let r := { r with field := v }` |
| `arr[i]` | `arr.getD i.toNat zero` |
| `arr[lo:hi]` | `arr.extract lo hi` |
| `len(v)` | `v.size.toUInt32` |
| `u32(x)` | `x.toUInt32` (or a typed literal) |
| `a < b`, `a == b` | `decide (a < b)`, `a == b` — Bool throughout |
| `c ? { A } \| { B }` (statement) | `let (vars) ← if c then do A; pure (vars) else do B; pure (vars)` over the variables either arm assigns |
| `c ? a \| b` (value) | `if c then a else b` |
| `while c { body }` | `def f.loopN (reads...) : Nat → Option (writes...)` with `0 => none`, recursing on the fuel |
| `g(args)` | `let (r, spans...) ← g args fuel`, hoisted before the statement; the span owners are rebound |
| `assert(c)` | `let () ← if c then pure () else none` |

Functions are emitted callee-first. Every function takes `fuel : Nat` and
threads it to every loop and call; the corpus harness supplies a fuel above
any loop's iteration count, so `none` is a disagreement, never a pass.

## 3. Two modeling choices, stated

Oak traps on an out-of-range read or write and on division by zero. The
extraction reads the element type's zero, drops the write, and divides to
zero. This is sound for the direction the experiment proves — an Oak run
that produced a verdict took no trapping path, and on such runs the model
computes the same values — and it is what the hand-written models already
assume. A model of trapping as `none` would make every expression monadic;
the choice here keeps expressions pure and the proofs tractable.

## 4. The subset, and what fails closed

Records of extractable fields; the fixed-width integers and Bool; arrays,
views, and spans of those; `while`; Bool conditionals in statement and value
position; calls to extracted functions, `len`, `view`, `span`, the widening
constructors, and `assert`; field assignment one level deep. Everything
else — strings, ADTs other than records, matches over variants, generics
that survive checking, recursion, methods, extern functions, closures,
`subslice`, the explicit conversions, floats, SIMD, FFI — is an error
naming the construct. Nothing is approximated.

## 5. Where it runs

`experiments/verification-poc/proof/OakTextExtracted.lean` is generated and
committed; `TestLeanExtractionMatchesCommitted` regenerates it and fails on
drift (`OAK_LEAN_EXTRACT_UPDATE=1` rewrites it). `OakTextCompare.lean`
requires the extraction, the hand-written transliteration, the proved file
model, and compiled Oak to return one verdict on every corpus case and on
the replayed real certificate (729 cases at the time of writing). The opt-in
verification workflow and the certificate gate build and run it.

## 6. Next

The theorem that the extraction equals the hand-written transliteration on
the decoder (`OakText.check`), so `check_refines` transfers to the extracted
model without a second corpus hop; then extraction of the scanner and the
stream checker so their comparison gates become theorems too; then the
constructs the verification programs need next (`subslice`, matches over
records, more conversions), each added with its own fail-closed test.

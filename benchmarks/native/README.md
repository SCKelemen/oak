# The native backend against the C backend

The question this harness answers: when the same Oak function is emitted
by the native backend (the Oak assembler alone, `oak build -native`;
`docs/spec/94-assembler.md` §9) instead of the C backend (clang over the
emitted C), how far behind is it, and why? The OS pilot is moving to the
native backend, so this is the gap that decides whether the golden-case
results hold there.

## The case

`utf8_valid.oak` is `stdlib/utf8.oak`'s validator with its four lookup
tables passed in as one 64-byte view (`valid_with`): the native backend
does not address package-level arrays yet, and the kernel is otherwise
what the C backend runs at simdutf's speed. `bench_utf8.c` times it over
the state-machines harness's 64 MB of valid UTF-8, best of five; `emit`
writes the native C and companion object the way the end-to-end tests
build (the CLI's `-emit-c` writes the C alone). `run.sh` does everything.

## Results

Apple arm64, 2026-09-13.

| Backend | ns/byte | GB/s | valid |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C backend, clang `-O2` over the emitted C | 0.08 | 13.2 | yes |
| Native backend, the Oak assembler's code | 0.38–0.40 | 2.6 | yes |

## What the numbers say

- The instructions are the same: every `simd` operation lowers to the
  NEON instruction the C helper wraps (`docs/spec/93-simd.md` §1.4). The
  five-fold gap is structure, and it ranks the native backend's work:
  1. **Inlining.** The kernel is a call tree — `valid_with` calls
     `check_blocks` per step, which calls `check_block` four times, which
     calls `special_cases`. clang flattens it into one loop with every
     vector in a register; the native backend emits the calls, and each
     call spills the live scratch vectors and reloads them.
  2. **Locals across calls.** A function that calls keeps its vector
     locals in sixteen-byte frame slots (AAPCS64 preserves only the low
     halves of v8–v15), so the validator's nine vector locals are loaded
     and stored around every step.
  3. **Guard elision.** Every vector load carries its two compares even
     where the loop condition `off <= len(bytes) - 64` already proves the
     access; the C backend's loads are unchecked there.
- Both backends agree on the verdict, and the end-to-end test
  (`compiler/e2e_native_simd_test.go`) checks every operation's result
  against the C backend, so the gap is speed, not meaning.

## Found on the way

- The native backend has no globals: `view(&table_high1)` of a
  package-level array is refused, so `utf8.valid` as written stays on the
  C backend. The object writer has the `adrp` relocation but not the
  page-offset `add`.
- It passes at most eight argument registers and has no stack arguments; a
  view costs two, so the literal kernel's five-view functions
  (`stdlib/literals.oak` `count`) do not lower, nor does a function with
  more than eight vector parameters.
- A `q` load indexes by bytes or by sixteens, never by a lane size in
  between, so vector loads over `u16`/`u32`/`u64` spans wait for a scaled
  index idiom.
- The verifier reports a false mismatch on a span read past its length
  (`literals.longest` with `len(starts) = 0`): the asm traps, the Oak model
  reads a fixed value. It fails a native build of any program containing
  such a function.
